# curdle
wordle clone for iOS

The same vocalbulary set as the original version with similar functionalities including colorcoding, number of attempts and statistics. In addition, 
we can view the history of past attempts and see the time taken to complete those games. Optimized for iPhone.

I created this wordle clone to learn Swift. There is a lot of opportunity to refactor since I am learning as I develop this app.
